**This was the first homework assignment for CS220 we were instructed to create a multipage website for a historical female scientist**
Some inspiration of our STEM User Interface design came from details of Mary Agnes Chase’s life. We included leaves in the design of our header because she was a botanist. We were also inspired by her world travel over the course of her career, so we created a map that would show her location based on the year of her life. Our page effectively implements the 8 Golden Rules:

Strive for consistency- Our web page features consistent font, Sans Serif, the most readable digital font. The color scheme (lavender, green, white) and overall style are also consistent throughout the pages. 

Seek universal usability- Because our web app can be used both on a computer and mobile device, we are expanding the usability among our different users. We also used large images and the alternative text, so users can read about the images. To get and keep the users attention, we varied the size and value of our fonts in our pages or titles and dates. 

Offer informative feedback- Informative feedback and responses are seen on our page when users hover over a button and the button is highlighted. 

Prevent errors, Permit easy reversal of actions- In our background page, users can use a slider to access the year of Chase’s life. The slider can move forwards and backwards, so reversal of action is easy here. 

Keep users in control- Users can click a button for a page based on the content that they would like to see. 

Reduce short-term memory load- Our web app only has four pages, which are all accessed by clicking a button with the page description. This consistency makes it easy to learn how to use
and remember how to use our site.
